`drop_alternatives.py` is a simple Python script for those who hate emails in
HTML and who prefer their inbox to have as many messages in pure text as
feasible. This script is generally meant to be run as a filter with procmail
FDM or some other mail delivery agent.

It tries to be moderately conservative and only act when things are
moderately safe:

* If the message is `multipart` and has a `text/plain` and a `text/html`
  part, keep the `text/plain` part only.

* In all other cases keep the message intact.

def compose_message(orig, body):
	"""
	Create new message with headers from `orig` and body from `body`.

	* `orig`: The original message.
	* `body`: The body that we want the new message to have.
	* Returns a new message.

	`compose_message` creates a new message with most of the fields from
	`orig`, with fields from `body` (if any) and with the payload of
	`body`. The fields excluded from `orig` are the following:

	* `content-length`
	* `content-type`
	* `lines`
	* `status`
